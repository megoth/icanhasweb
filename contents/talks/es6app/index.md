"Building a web app with ES6" is a presentation constructed as a part of a workshop at [Ã…pen sone for eksperimentell informatikk](http://sonen.ifi.uio.no/). The goal was to introduce the participants to ES6 using [JSPM](http://jspm.io/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). The goal was a bit ambitious, to say the least...

The presentation is using a web app, and throughout the presentation you're building the presentation itself. I still like the idea, but the participants need to have a bit of knowledge on JavaScript.
