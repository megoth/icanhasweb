Lately I've been researching the decentralized social media-scene, with projects such as [diaspora*](https://diasporafoundation.org/), [Solid](https://github.com/solid), [friendica](http://friendica.com/), [Hubzilla](https://github.com/redmatrix/hubzilla), and [Akasha](http://akasha.world/) (and a couple of other blockchain-based technologies that I won't mention).

The scene has great potential that can resolve in great services/tools, but I don't think it's quite _there_ yet with regards to adoption by the masses. Right now it's for those with specific interests in decentralized technologies in general, not so much for those simply wanting an alternative to centralized social media such as [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/).

In this article I want to share my thoughts on what such an alternative should entail, and what benefits and challenges we look at.

(If it is not obvious; these are my thoughts and ideas, and they are far from complete and may misrepresent the projects I reference. I'm eager to learn more, and invite you to a productive and meaningful conversation in the [comments](#disqus_thread).)

I'm going to use decentralized social media (DSM) as the working term throughout this article, as I want to emphasize the role it needs to fill: an alternative to the centralized social media (CSM). Other related terms are decentralized social networks, decentralized web applications, and decentralized web communities.

## The platform

The beforementioned projects are all doing a lot of great work, and I hope to be able to dive more into them and get to know their specifics. But from what I've been able to gather, they're not fulfilling all of the features for decentralized social media as a platform to be successful. These are:

1. An emphasis on giving users ownership of their data
2. Tools that allow users to manage access to their data, presented in intuitive and smart ways
3. A standardized format for data to be exchanged across networks and services (I believe Resource Description Framework (RDF) to be the best bet here)
4. Strategies for monetization for data facilitators, data aggregators, and content producers

Until these features are in place, I don't think we'll have a platform for decentralized social media that will be successful.

### Intellectual property

### Content management

### Linked data

### Monetization

## Benefits

If we are able to build a platform that faciliates decentralized social media, I think there are plenty of benefits that we may reap.

### Ownership

The greatest benefit of decentralized social media is - in my view - the possibility of allowing users full ownership of their data. Although Facebook allows you to backup your data, and in that sense extract data from their services, it is part of their [terms of service](https://www.facebook.com/terms) that &#8220;you grant [Facebook] a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook&#8221;, meaning everything you put on their services can be distributed and used throughout their services (until you delete it).

There is also the problem that once you backup your data from services such as Facebook, it is very difficult to upload it to another service and make use of it in useful ways.

Decentralized social media should be made with the assumption that users own the content they post, and that they can manage it as they prefer, meaning:

* A user can move their content whenever they want,
* If a user moves their content to another service, the service should offer the possibility of redirecting subscribers of the users to the new service (so that connections facilitated via the service are not broken; this should be compensated somehow, but not with such a cost that a user effectively gets locked to that service),
* Anyone should be able to host servers that facilitates the content (i.e. they take full responsibility for the security and privacy of that content).

### Monetization

Ownership of data is also a problem for all content generators/facilitators (such as news outlets, publications, music artists, photographers, etc) that cannot use Facebook as a distribution channel for paid content. This is not a problem unique to Facebook, it's a problem with all social media that gets it revenue primarily from advertisements. After all, the main focus for these services is to gather data on their users so that they present advertisements to them.

Now, don't misunderstand, I have no problem with services that generate their income from advertisements. I just wish they did it in such a way that didn't take away ownership of data away from their audience. A better, more honest approach to this, would be that advertisers _asked_ their audience for the data needed to present ads that may be relevant to them. This approach would allow audiences to better administrate what content they wish to share, and maybe even allow for transactions to take place (i.e. advertisers paying for the privilege of access to your data). These transactions could of course be handled so that a consumer would access a service by allowing that service access to (parts of) their data, and in that way declare quid pro quo. (An argument could be made that this is what Facebook is in practice doing today - an argument I would agree to if users had a greater understanding of what terms they agree to as they post content.)

### Personal use

...

There is personal data that may not be moved so easily, either for the sake of the users privacy or because society cannot allow users to control access to that data, examples being medical data and criminal records. But this data may also be highly relevant for users to have personal access to, e.g. utilizing agents to alleviate aspects of their lives (e.g. a technical system that taps into users food-consumption and toilet usage to serve as a "personal doctor", and that needs the medical history to look for certain risk factors). In this cases governments should facilitate the data but allow personal access via highly secure channels/APIs. In turn the governments require that these agents adhere to certain rules/laws, and that their users privacy is protected.
