<p>I’ve started writing on my essay, it’s available <a href="http://folk.uio.no/arnehass/master/essay.pdf">here</a>. I’ll update it when suitable, and updates on major revisions will be posted on this blog.</p>
<p>I’m sorry that I’ve been a lazy ass regarding postings on this blog, but I was vacating in Thailand for three weeks. As you may imagine, coming home after three weeks ment a whole lot of catching up. But now I’m home, all is good, and I’ll try posting more regularly ^\_^</p>
