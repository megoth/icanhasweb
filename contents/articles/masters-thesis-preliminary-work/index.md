<p>Almost a whole month since my last post, not good… This doesn’t proclaim a promising start for this blog. But I hope you’ll excuse me, it’s been a crazy month in terms of exams, christmas dinners, working, voluntarily work, etc etc etc. I won’t bore you with the details.</p>
<p>But I will bore you with my newest undertaking: my Master’s Thesis! ^\_^ In short: It’s derived from Tim Berners-Lee asking on <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who would be interested in working on a standard very cool jqery-like RDF API for Javascript?</p></blockquote>
<p>Typo aside, Kjetil Kjernsmo made note of this, and presented it as a possible theme for a master’s thesis. I jumped right on it, being quite interested in Tim Berners-Lee, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, development of APIs and JavaScript. I didn’t really know what <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"><abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr></a> was, but the other keywords intrigued me to learn about it. And hey, it’s part of making data open (enriching the quality of the data served and connecting them across domains), another interest of mine. So I think this can be quite interesting!</p>
<p>I will be using this blog to promote thoughts and key ideas/findings that I’ll stumble upon in my work. <a href="https://wiki.uio.no/matnat/ifi/arnehass-master/index.php/Hovedside">A wiki has been set up for me</a> (as the first student ever on my university requesting it for the usage in a master’s thesis ^\_^), and I’ll use that as primary resource for connecting thoughts/ideas/findings. I’ve written about my <a href="https://wiki.uio.no/matnat/ifi/arnehass-master/index.php/Preliminary_work">preliminary work</a> for those interested in the details.</p>
<p>I won’t be writing anything more before the vacation is at its end. Merry Christmas to you all (although a bit delayed), and a Happy New Year!</p>
