<p>I’ve made my third iteration of the disposition available on the net. As always, it’s available on&nbsp;<a href="http://folk.uio.no/arnehass/master/disposition.pdf">http://folk.uio.no/arnehass/master/disposition.pdf</a>, but I’ve also updated <a href="https://github.com/megoth/Semantic-Web---Javascript---A-master-thesis">the project on GitHub</a> if you wish to see earlier revisions.</p>
<p>For those not so interested in Javascript and Semantic Web, frown not. At my work we’ve been developing a new framework for structuring abstractions of CSS with <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>. I’ve also tested the concepts on one of my sideprojects, Zetty (will probably explain it in a later post), where I work with <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, and it’s a breeze to work with.</p>
<p>I’ll write some words on it when given time, which hopefully is soon ^_^</p>
