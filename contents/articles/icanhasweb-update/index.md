I've been vacationing at my parents home in Ris√∏r, and finally found some time to update this webpage.
As part of my work on [the Solid project](https://solidproject.org/) at [inrupt](https://inrupt.com/) I've become more 
aware of privacy issues, amongst them the unnecessary exposure to tracking by services that I used (Google Analytics, 
Google Fonts, and Disqus). (There are more good reasons to drop Disqus, as 
[listed at Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/Disqus#Criticism).) 

Upon starting to do this, I also realized I needed to upgrade my dependencies, and clean up some of the tools. (Ain't
it typical...) But all in all it took me a couple of hours, and now it should all work nicely. If you find any issues, 
[please let me know](https://github.com/megoth/icanhasweb/issues).
