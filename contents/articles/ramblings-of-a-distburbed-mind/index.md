I've been thinking about a story for a while. The inspiration was a panel discussion on games named [Digitale liv - nye ord om spill](http://www.frittord.no/aktuelt/digitale-liv-nye-ord-om-spill/) (Norwegian, means something like Digital lifes - new words on games) that were arranged December 2nd by [Fritt Ord](http://www.fritt-ord.no/). About a month later, I finally got it out of my head, and I've published it at Medium.

It's a fictional short story named [Ramblings of a disturbed mind](https://medium.com/@megoth/ramblings-of-a-disturbed-mind-f8b2b19965f9), and it takes about 21 minutes to read. I hope you enjoy it ^\_^
