<p>I don’t feel this to be a good excuse for me not writing anything in two weeks (failing my attempt to <a href="http://icanhasweb.wordpress.com/2010/10/24/hello-world/">write once a week</a>), but a lot is going on now in terms of exams, finding a theme and supervisors for my master thesis, as well as christmas dinners and general assemblies (I’m either working in a student organization, or interested in quite a number of others)… I hope you can excuse me for another couple of weeks (I might post my thoughts on a master thesis during that time, hoping to gather some respond from the community I believe I’ll work toward, but I can’t promise anything yet).</p>
<p>With this post I wanted to direct your attention toward <a href="http://24ways.org/">24 ways</a>, an annual christmas calendar that posts interesting texts and tutorials of interest to developers in all webby. First out is <a href="http://twitter.com/drewm">Drew McLellan</a> with his writing on <a href="http://24ways.org/2010/finding-your-way-with-static-maps">Finding Your Way with Static Maps</a>, covering the need for progressive enhancement when embedding from <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>. Enjoy! ^\_^</p>
