<p>So it has started, my new blog. I’m not a productive writer per ce, but I hope to gain some momentum to my motivation with this blog.</p>
<p>I will blog about design for the web, with focus on front end, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></a>. But I think I’ll also write about the layers below, since I’m currently a student at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ifi.uio.no/english/"><abbr title="Institutt for Informatikk (Department of Informatics)">IFI</abbr></a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.uio.no/english/"><abbr title="Universitetet i Oslo (University of Oslo)">UiO</abbr></a>. During my years as a student and part-time system developer, in addition to my general interest in aspects that drive production and consumtion on the Internet, I’ve written in languages such as&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a> (my first love),&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly</a> (never again!),&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> (my lastest endeavor).</p>
<p>I will base my writing on my experiences as a student, a system developer at <abbr title="Senter for Pasientmedvirkning og Sykepleieforskning (Centre for Shared Decision Making and Nursing Research)">SPS</abbr> (whose pages are being ported&nbsp;<abbr title="at the moment">atm</abbr>), and as an eager participant in&nbsp;<a href="http://cyb.no"><abbr title="Cybernetisk Selskab">CYB</abbr></a>. In addition, I’m a big fan of the work presented at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://adactio.com/">adactio</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://snook.ca/">Snook.ca</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/">HTML5Rocks Tutorials</a>, so I’ll probably gain influence through their words. For the norwegian readers out there, I also enjoy reading the words of&nbsp;<a href="http://nrkbeta.no/">NRK Beta</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://ux.no/blog/">Logica UX</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kjokkenfesten.no/">Kjøkkenfesten</a>.</p>
<span class="more"></span>
<p>I’ve chosen to go for&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> as my blogging-platform of choice, because it&nbsp;<a title="My norwegian blog" href="http://megoth.wordpress.com/">has served me well in the past</a>. It has good tools for writing, publishing the content, and it’s free, which is all I need.</p>
<p>The name of the blog was a spur of the moment, originating from my username at the university (arnehass), and thought it might appeal to designers abroad, since it after all would be fun if I could use this blog to get in contact with people as brilliant as those mentioned before.</p>
<p>I will try writing one entry a week, most probably on sundays, since that’s the only day I can relax, lean back with my feet in the air, and reflect on those things neglected on busy days. Some of those things are thoughts on design, and I will share them here.</p>
<p>And I apologize up front for any mistypings and faulty sentences I might construct. English is my second language, and although I strive to write good, I cannot guarantee it^\_^ (<abbr title="by the way">btw</abbr>, I’ll probably use smileys more often, since I’m somewhat addicted to its use=P).</p>
<p>Until next time, perhaps you’ll check out the new website my company published this week,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.communicaretools.org/?lang=en-US">communicaretools.org</a>. I’ve designed it in collaboration with one excellent graphical designer,&nbsp;<a href="http://tza.no/">Tzachi Itzchaki</a>, and two superb content strategists,&nbsp;Astrid Krahn (until October 1st 2010) and Gro Roksand.</p>
