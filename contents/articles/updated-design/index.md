<p>Sorry for the delay of professional related content, but just wanted to note the updated design.</p>
<p>As always, the code is available on github, in the projects&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/megoth/minimalist">minimalist</a>&nbsp;(designed as a wordpress theme) and <a href="https://github.com/megoth/icanhasweb-splash">icanhasweb-splash</a> (the splash page used as root page).</p>
<p>I would love some feedback if you have any.</p>
