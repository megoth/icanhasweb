<p>Last week I finished writing on an essay that is part of my master thesis. I was thinking about posting about it this weekend, but, well, with all that’ve happened, that got downgraded. But I feel it’s time to move on with life now.</p>
<p>This is the abstract of the essay.</p>
<blockquote><p>In this essay I’ve described Semantic Web (SW) and some of the standards&nbsp;encapsulated. Based on this I’ve created a list of functionalities required of&nbsp;a Javascript (JS)-library working toward SW. Then I present existing JS-libraries working with these standards, and discuss how they fill certain needs&nbsp;in the world of SW and JS.</p>
<p>I’ve concluded that the JS-library rdfQuery is the most evolved library&nbsp;as of today.</p></blockquote>
