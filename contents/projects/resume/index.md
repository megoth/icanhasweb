Resume is the codebase I use to generate my personal CV. It's built upon a template I found, and is usually updated around the times I'm looking around at possible job offers.

I also constructed a competence chart where I constructed a lot of customs command to output tables like the ones that can be seen in [my online CV](http://cv.icanhasweb.net/#skills).
