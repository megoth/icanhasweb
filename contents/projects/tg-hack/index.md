"TG Hacking Compo" is the website used to serve the hacking competition at [The Gathering 2013](http://www.gathering.org/tg13/). It served a set of tasks designed by [Aleksi Luukkonen](https://bitbucket.org/Aleksi/), [Hans Fredrik Furholt](https://bitbucket.org/hansffu/), and Julian Bark Jark. It proved a bit unstable during the computer party, but it did the job.
