The idea behind Swocial was to create distributed systems that served some social purpose and built upon Semantic Web technologies. I realized immediately that this was an endeavor I couldn't do myself, so I started out writing a manifesto that was going to describe the project and its ideas.

Unfortunately I didn't have the time to pursue it, and it quickly went cold. It's still something I would like to bring life back into at some point, but don't know when that will be.
