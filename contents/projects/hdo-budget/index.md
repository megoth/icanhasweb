hdo-budget was an experiment conducted by [Holder de ord](https://www.holderdeord.no/) to explore how to present a state budget using the capabilities of a web app in a manner that was easy-to-understand and meaningful in terms of gaining insight.

We utilized [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) as the main engine behind the site.

I was the main developer on the code, but had a lot of help from the Holder de ord-team to find, structure and clean the numbers.
