Holder de ord is an organization that functions as a parliamentary monitoring website. By analyzing the promises made by the Norwegian political parties and their votes during the following years, they try to see how these two data sets matches, and whether or not the politicians keep their word.

I've been working on Holder de ord off and on, and not so much on their primary website.
