Ifi-ordenen is the official website of [Hennes Majestet Keiserpingvinen den Fornemme](http://ordenen.ifi.uio.no/) (Her Majesty the Royal Penguin the Distinguished), a knight order that focuses on honoring people that have accomplished great deeds for the students at [Department of Informatics](http://ifi.uio.no).

The website consists of static HTML-pages that are built using [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/), whereas the CSS is structured using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

I've been the main driver behind this project, primarily as developer, but have received help from my fellow members in producing content.
