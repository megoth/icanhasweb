hdo-quiz is a small mobile app that explores the possibility of having a quiz-app that draws political promises from the APIs of [Holder de ord](https://www.holderdeord.no/) and prompts the user to guess which party made the promise by swiping the promise to a given by party to the left or to the right of the screen (i.e. Tinder-like interface).

[Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) is the main framework used to build the app, but [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is used to structure and bundle the code.

I've been developing the code alone for now, but may include more members of the Holder de ord-team if we decide to explore the app further.
