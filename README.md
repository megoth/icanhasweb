# icanhasweb

The code behind the personal webpage of Arne Hassel. The design is extracted into its own theme ([minimalist](https://github.com/megoth/minimalist)). In order to build the website, you need to have minimalist as a folder within the project. (minimalist requires [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).)

The website is static, built using [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/).
